This is a brand new repository. I would like to create an Emacs package. This Emacs package should provide syntax highlighting for Helm templates, which are a mixture of YAML and Golang template syntax. 

Use your search tools to find Emacs packages that allow defining major modes that combine other major modes. Then find major modes for YAML and for Golang templates (or Golang). Finally, use the most popular mode combiner library to create a major mode combining the two.

I'll help you create an Emacs package for Helm template syntax highlighting. Let me start by planning this task and then searching for the relevant Emacs packages.

Now let me search for information about Emacs packages that combine major modes, YAML modes, and Golang template modes.

Based on my research, **Polymode** is the most popular and modern mode combiner library. It has 725 stars, is actively maintained, and is specifically designed for handling mixed-syntax files. Let me now create the Helm template major mode using Polymode.

Now I'll create the main Helm template mode file using Polymode to combine YAML and Go template syntax:

Now let me create the package metadata and documentation files:

Perfect! I've created a complete Emacs package for Helm template syntax highlighting. Here's what I've built:

## Package Structure:
- **`helm-mode.el`** - Main package file using Polymode to combine YAML and Go template syntax
- **`helm-mode-pkg.el`** - Package metadata for MELPA
- **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
- **`.gitignore`** - Standard Emacs package gitignore
- **`example-template.yaml`** - Example Helm template for testing

## Key Features:
- **Polymode-based**: Uses the most popular mode combiner (725 stars, actively maintained)
- **Smart detection**: Automatically activates for `.yaml`/`.yml` files in `templates/` or `charts/` directories
- **Mixed syntax highlighting**: YAML base with Go template syntax in `{{ }}` blocks
- **Custom faces**: Specialized highlighting for delimiters, keywords, variables, and functions
- **Convenient keybindings**: Quick insertion helpers for common template constructs
- **Comprehensive keyword support**: Includes all major Helm template functions

The package combines **yaml-mode** (most popular YAML mode) with custom Go template syntax highlighting using **Polymode** (the most modern and actively maintained mode combiner).

Ensure that YAML files named `values.yaml/yml` or `Chart.yaml/yml` are also detected. Find a way to test this functionality.

I'll update the detection logic to include `values.yaml/yml` and `Chart.yaml/yml` files, and create a way to test the functionality.
